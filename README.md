# Global F1 Visa Insights Dashboard

## Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard, titled "Global F1 Visa Insights," was designed for the University of New Haven's Enrollment Operations team to simplify and demystify 27 years of international student F1 visa approval data. 
The main objective was to help the team understand F1 visa approval patterns across decades to inform smarter outreach strategies.

The project involved cleaning and consolidating 27 years of F1 visa data from the U.S. Department of State. 
Key design principles focused on simplicity, highlighting the Top 5 countries by approvals each year and essential metrics like year, country, and F1 Visa Count. 
Interactive features, such as a vertical year slider and a searchable country dropdown, were incorporated for easy exploration. 
Beyond standard metrics, the dashboard aims to uncover surprising trends and "fun facts," turning raw data into conversation starters for strategic discovery. 
Ultimately, it serves as a strategic tool that is easy to use, visually clean, and provides insights in seconds, supporting data-driven decision-making.
